# Deep_Neural_Network_Application-Image_Classification

This repo presents my own implementation for a deep neural network (a cat classifier) from Coursera's "Deep Learning Specialization". For this project I implemented all the building blocks of a neural network, so as to be able to use them to create a neural network of any architecture for image classification. In the context of this deep neural net application, I experimented with different model structures to see in practice how each one behaves and witnessed the superior accuracy it offers, e.g. compared to a logistic regression model and a shallow network.
